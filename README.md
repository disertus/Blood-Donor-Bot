# Blood-Donor-Bot

### Intro
The creation of **@donor_notify_bot** was inspired by lack of certain types of donor blood in blood banks in Ukraine.
Bot's notification system should raise people's awareness about the existing shortages.

#### What this telegram bot does?:
- Checks the availability of different blood types at the municipal blood bank
- Collects the data about users' blood type
- Schedules the donations using the info about users' last donation
- Informs the users when there is a lack of blood at the blood bank if their blood type matches
- Stores the chronological data about the availability of specific blood types into MySQL Server (possibility of further data analysis)
